          q: 'Does the number of fields affect the price?',
          a: 'Yes, forms with many fields (over 50 fields per page) may incur additional costs due to increased processing complexity. We analyze your form and provide a transparent quote.'
        },
        {
          q: 'Does the paper condition matter?',

          q: 'Can I submit forms in binders or folders?',
